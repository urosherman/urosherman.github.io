Welcome to my homepage. I am a PhD Candidate at the Graduate School of Economics, Finance and Management ([GSEFM](https://www.gsefm.eu/about-us.html)) at [Goethe University Frankfurt](https://www.wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de/en/home.html), Germany. 

My research interests lie primarily in `macroeconomics`, with a special focus on monetary and fiscal policy within `Heterogeneous-Agent New Keynesian models` and the intersection of macroeconomics with `international and corporate finance`. 

Before my graduate studies, I worked as a (senior-)macroeconomist in the Analysis and Research Department @ [Bank of Slovenia](https://www.bsi.si/en).
