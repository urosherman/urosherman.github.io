Welcome to my homepage.  

I am a `Postdoctoral Researcher` at [Aix-Marseille School of Economics (AMSE)](https://www.amse-aixmarseille.fr/en). 

My primary research interests include monetary and fiscal policy, labour markets, and the intersection of macroeconomics with international and corporate finance.

Some of my work can be found [here](/publications/).
