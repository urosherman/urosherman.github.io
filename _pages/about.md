Welcome to my homepage. I am a Post-doctoral fellow at [Aix-Marseille School of Economics (AMSE)](https://www.amse-aixmarseille.fr/en).

My research interests lie primarily in `macroeconomics`, with a special focus on monetary and fiscal policy within `Heterogeneous-Agent New Keynesian models`, and the intersection of macroeconomics with `international and corporate finance`. Some of my recent work can be found [here](/publications/). 

From 2009 to 2015, I worked as a (Senior) Economist in the Analysis and Research Department @ [Bank of Slovenia](https://www.bsi.si/en).
