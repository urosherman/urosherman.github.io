Welcome to my homepage. 

Since September 2023, I have been  a `Postdoctoral Researcher` at [Aix-Marseille School of Economics (AMSE)](https://www.amse-aixmarseille.fr/en). 

I am a `macroeconomist` working on monetary and fiscal policy within `Heterogeneous-Agent New Keynesian models` and at the intersection of macroeconomics with `international and corporate finance`. 
 
Some of my recent research can be found [here](/publications/).

From 2009 to 2015, I worked as a (Senior) Economist in the Analysis and Research Department @ [Bank of Slovenia](https://www.bsi.si/en).
