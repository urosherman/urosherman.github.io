abstract = {We propose a novel way, based on the liability composition of banks and firms, to identify a shock to the supply of foreign funds to banks, and investigate its dynamic effects on bank lending to firms, output, and prices. We find that the increase in the supply of foreign funds to banks generates a strong and persistent increase in lending and output, while prices increase with a delay. Shocks to the supply of foreign funds to banks are also an important driver of business cycles, bank lending, and the co-movement between bank loans and output. When we distinguish between the behaviour of domestic and foreign-owned banks, we find that foreign-owned banks are slower in passing the increase in foreign funding to firms.}

  abstract = {This paper first provides empirical evidence that the labour market for the less educated, who also tend to be poorer, is substantially more volatile than the labour market for the well-educated, who tend to be richer. This is done by estimating job-finding rates by educational attainment for several European countries. These rates tend to be smaller and more volatile at lower education levels. We then construct a stylised HANK model augmented with search and matching and ex-ante heterogeneity in terms of the labour market. We show that monetary policy has stronger effects when the job market for less educated and hence poorer is more volatile. The reason is that poorer workers have the most procyclical income coupled with the highest marginal propensity to consume. After an expansionary monetary policy shock, their consumption increases strongly, causing aggregate consumption to increase by more. This fuels labour demand and feeds back to the increase in labour income of the poor, amplifying the initial effect. The same mechanism carries over to forward guidance.}

  abstract = {This paper studies the role of sector-specific employment risk in the transmission of monetary policy. I start with the observation that sectoral net worker flows can be informative about sectoral employment risk and, thus, the strength of the sectoral precautionary saving motive. I find that households working in cyclical sectors, which are more exposed to business cycles and feature higher employment risk, tend to accumulate more net liquid assets than households working in sectors less exposed to business cycle fluctuations. This difference in net liquid assets is larger at low wealth levels. Then, I build a two-sector Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian model in which sectors differ in terms of endogenous employment risk and study the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. The consumption response following an expansionary monetary policy is larger and more persistent in the sector with higher employment risk. I identify two channels that determine through which employment risk affects sectoral and aggregate consumption responses.}

  abstract={In this paper, we investigate whether a firm’s composition of foreign liabilities matters for its resilience during economic turmoil and examine which characteristics determine a firm’s foreign capital structure. Using firm-level data, we corroborate previous findings from the (international) macroeconomic literature that the composition of foreign liabilities matters for a country’s susceptibility to external shocks. We find that firms with a positive equity share in their foreign liabilities were less affected by the global financial crisis and also less likely to default in the aftermath of the crisis. In addition, we show that larger, more open, and more productive firms tend to have a higher equity share in total foreign liabilities.},

  abstract={This paper studies the effects of financial leverage and foreign financing on firm performance before and during the recent crisis, using a large panel of Slovenian companies. We find a significant negative impact of leverage on firm performance, even when we explicitly control for the reverse causality between the two variables. The negative effect, albeit weaker, persists also in the crisis period. Firms with some foreign debt performed better on average than firms relying only on domestic financing. At the same time, they suffered a stronger decrease in performance if their total leverage increased. Moreover, when we explicitly control for the amount of foreign financing, we find that it has a positive and highly significant effect on firm performance. The significant positive effect of foreign financing in the pre-crisis period seems to be entirely driven by privately owned firms, while the effects are negative for the state owned companies. During the crisis, the effects are positive but insignificant for both ownership types.Finally, when comparing domestic and foreign owned firms, we see no substantial variation in the coefficients.},
